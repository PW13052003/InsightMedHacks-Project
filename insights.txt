Here are the insights from our analysis:-

1. Age Distribution:-
--> Average age of a patient is about 54 years.
--> A standard deviation of 8.96 shows that most patients are around the age of 54.
--> The range of the ages is 39, relatively high showing that there are much younger patients as well.

CONCLUSION: While the likelihood of breast cancer increases with age, it is required for younger people to be cautious
as well because they are at risk too (even though it is lesser).

2.Survival Months:-
--> Average number of months of survival post detection are 71.30, i.e. a little under 6 years.
--> The range is 100, which signifies that different patients have different lifespans.

CONCLUSION: Different patients will have different outcomes which are subject to tumor stage and quality of treatment.

3. Tumor size and regional nodes examined:-
--> Average tumor size is 30.71mm.
--> The range 139 shows the tumor sizes could vary considerably between patients.
--> Average regional nodes examined are 14.36.
--> The range of 60 shows however that some patients were examined more carefully than others.

CONCLUSION: Typically, most tumors would have a size around 30mm but in some patients, the tumors can be much bigger. The
number of regional nodes examined can give an insight on the quality of healthcare that patients receive. If the number is
higher, it means that the patients have been more carefully examined, which increases the likelhood of an accurate assessment
on the part of the doctor. If the number is lower, it could lead to more inaccuracies in the diagnosis.
