Here are the insights from our analysis:-

1. Age Distribution:-
--> Average age of a patient is about 54 years.
--> A standard deviation of 8.96 shows that most patients are around the age of 54.
--> The range of the ages is 39, relatively high showing that there are much younger patients as well.

CONCLUSION: While the likelihood of breast cancer increases with age, it is possible for younger people to be cautious
as well because they are at risk too (eventhough it is lesser).
